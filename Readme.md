Care and Actions for Strays (CAS) was founded in 2005 to rescue, rehabilitate and care for animals neglected, abused and in need of medical attention or care. The founding members have each had extensive experience in assisting and caring for animals in distress. They recognized the need for improvement in many areas of animal welfare in Brunei as well as a need for an effective and humane urban stray management program to create a better environment for the whole society.

At the core of the CAS vision is to seek and implement no-kill solutions (unless for critically ill / injured animals with no chance of a full recovery) to the urban stray problem and animals in need. Through a series of identified projects, CAS aims to take action in the Brunei community to bring out the best in Bruneians and to bring about a place where people and animals co-exist harmoniously medical attention or care.

**Problem**
- Insufficient funds as we are the only stray animal welfare organization in Brunei and the whole of Brunei calls on CAS to help strays. Need to reach more people who are willingly to give small amounts on mon thly basis, crowd funding platform required.
- Low adoption rates. need to reach more people to adopt from CAS instead of buying cats and dogs so that we can help more animals and get them off the streets
- Lack of awareness and education on responsible pet ownership which includes spaying / neutering pets to prevent unwanted puppies and kittens, no chaining n no caging of pets while not allowing them to roam the streets and create a nuisance to neighbors,
- Need animal data management to manage, track and record animals rescued, rehomed, spayed etc
- Lack of committed active volunteers and volunteers data management.
