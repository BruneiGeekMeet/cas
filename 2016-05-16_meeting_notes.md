# Meeting Notes

- Date: 2016-05-14
- Contacts: Ada / Amanda

## Details of dicussion
- CAS want's to build a microchipping database of pets
- One reason for microchipping overseas is to
   - Identify owners of lost pets
   - Penalties for owners who let pets go astray

## Microchipping info
- In UK they use Tracer's Petlog http://www.tracer-microchips.co.uk/petlog/
- CAS partly wants to do microchipping for the purpose to allow taking animals overseas (e.g. when owners leave the country and want to take pet with them)
- As this would be an "immigration" kind of issue, there could be legalities / regulations / certifications that need to be put in place for an actual system that is globally recognised
- CAS will need to look into these regulations if to use a microchipping system for these purposes

## Brunei situation
- Currently owner and pet data is currently all saved/owned individually by vets
- No central repository
- No sharing
- Not sure if vets want to share information (for business reasons locking pet owner's into their practise?)
- For now the system can still be built for CAS's records
- CAS focuses on animal welfare so the system is mean to be more for the animal rather than owners and to have the animal's best interest
- If CAS animals are found to be strays or when owners leave, CAS would like the animals returned to CAS in order for CAS to assign them on to their future home
- CAS whats to be 'in the know' when re-homed / moved

## Current project guidelines
- Mentioned that they likely only need it as a local system in one office but they do have a remote office in another district as well
- So likely a database like system with user logins and ability to search
- Most data is just a single value
- Some data requires a history so that they can be refer to (e.g. weight, so they can track if there is a possible medical issue if weight fluctuates a lot)

### Data to save
- Microchip ID / serial number
- Breed
- Brief description
- Age (more specifically year of birth: age can be calculated)
- Neutered
- Medications
- Weight (history needed)
- Vaccinated (on going thing, history needed)
- Condition of the animal on leaving (history needed)
- Notes (history needed)
- Pictures
- 'Home base' (CAS / Vet 1 / Vet 2)
    - Name
    - Address
    - Contact
- Owner details
    - Name
    - Contact
    - Address
    - Time left in Brunei (so that can contact them before leaving)
- Events e.g.
    - When animal is re-homed

### Search options
- Search by microchip to see animal and owner details
- Search by address to identify good owners
